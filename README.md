# BlueXR

OpenXR SDK with enhanced build system and added logic.

## Build

Make sure you have initialized an environment variable ANDROID_NDK_PATH which points to the NDK
installation. For example on windows this could look like:

ANDROID_NDK_PATH : "C:/Users/<user_name>/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/ndk/29.0.13113456"
